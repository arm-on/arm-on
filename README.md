### Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Arman Malekzadeh.

I grew up in Lahijan, a city in the north of Iran. Since I was a child, I had a passion for working with computers. After a few years, the passion inside me was transformed into a dream of becoming a computer scientist. The dream made me leave my hometown to start a long academic journey as a CS student in Tehran, where I met a lot of people having big ideas. It has been many years since the start of that journey, and I still feel like the same boy with the same dream!


ðŸ’¡ Quote of the day by Diogenes: 
>A philosopher named Aristippus, who had quite willingly sucked up to Dionysus and won himself a spot at his court, saw Diogenes cooking lentils for a meal. If you would only learn to compliment Dionysus, you wouldn't have to live on lentils. Diogenes replied, But if you would only learn to live on lentils, you wouldn't have to flatter Dionysus.
