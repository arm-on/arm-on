### Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Arman Malekzadeh.

I grew up in Lahijan, a city in the north of Iran. Since I was a child, I had a passion for working with computers. After a few years, the passion inside me was transformed into a dream of becoming a computer scientist. The dream made me leave my hometown to start a long academic journey as a CS student in Tehran, where I met a lot of people having big ideas. It has been over 7 years since the start of that journey, and I still feel like the same boy with the same dream!

### Research ðŸ”­

My research is mainly focused on Natural Language Processing (NLP). I designed the first intelligent Persian reverse dictionary while I was a master's student at Amirkabir University of Technology, also known as the Polytechnic University of Tehran. Nowadays, I am working on developing robust Persian language models at the CE department of Sharif University of Technology.
