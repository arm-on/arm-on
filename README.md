### Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Arman Malekzadeh.

I grew up in Lahijan, a city in the north of Iran. Since I was a child, I had a passion for working with computers. After a few years, the passion inside me was transformed into a dream of becoming a computer scientist. The dream made me leave my hometown to start a long academic journey as a CS student in Tehran, where I met a lot of people having big ideas. It has been many years since the start of that journey, and I still feel like the same boy with the same dream!


ðŸ’¡ Quote of the day by John Cleese: 
>It's easier to do trivial things that are urgent than it is to do important things that are not, like thinking. And it's also easier to do little things we know we can do than to start on big things that we're not so sure about.
