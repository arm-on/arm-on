### Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Arman Malekzadeh.

I grew up in Lahijan, a city in the north of Iran. Since I was a child, I had a passion for working with computers. After a few years, the passion inside me was transformed into a dream of becoming a computer scientist. The dream made me leave my hometown to start a long academic journey as a CS student in Tehran, where I met a lot of people having big ideas. It has been many years since the start of that journey, and I still feel like the same boy with the same dream!
